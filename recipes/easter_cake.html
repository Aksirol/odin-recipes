    <h1><strong>Description</strong></h1>
    <p>This unbaked cheese paska was one of my mother Sofia's traditional Ukrainian Easter recipes. She passed away in
        1995, so I have been making it ever since. It's very rich, easy to make, and always a hit. Decorate with the
        fruits of your choice.</p>

    <h1><strong>Ingredients</strong></h1>
    <ul>
        <li>16 ounces farmer's cheese</li>
        <li>12 ounces cream cheese (such as Philadelphia), softened</li>
        <li>Â½ cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>4 hard-boiled egg yolks</li>
        <li>1 cup superfine white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon grated lemon zest, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon grated orange zest, or more to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h1><strong>Steps</strong></h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine farmer's cheese, cream cheese, butter, and egg yolks in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a
            paddle attachment; mix on low speed to combine. Add sugar, vanilla extract, lemon juice, lemon zest, and
            orange zest; mix until smooth. </li>
        <li>Line a sieve with dampened cheesecloth, leaving an overhang on all sides. Place over a plate that will catch
            any additional liquid that drains out. Spoon paska mixture into the cheesecloth. Fold the ends of the
            cheesecloth over the mixture. Cover with a plate and set a heavy weight on top. Chill until firm, 8 to 24
            hours.</li>
        <li>Remove the weighted plate and unfold the cheesecloth ends. Use the cheesecloth ends to lift the paska out.
            Invert onto a plate and peel away the cheesecloth.</li>
    </ol>

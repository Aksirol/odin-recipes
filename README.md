# odin-recipes

This is the first project on the Odin Projects website, which is all about creating your first website. 

The task was to create a website where the main page would contain links to other pages with recipes. The recipe pages should have images, a "Description" section, "Ingredients" with an unordered list, and "Steps" with an ordered list. 

This project helped me to consolidate the material I learned and feel confident in working with basic HTML text formatting tags.
